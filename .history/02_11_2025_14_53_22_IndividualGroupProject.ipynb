This would work because I am trying to guess which category players fall into, whether they subscribe or not, based on their age. Seeing that subscritpion is a categorical variable classification is what is being predicted. The limitations are that this would only look at one variable, ignoring the fact others may also influence the prediction. This also requires the assumption that age can predict whether or not players will subscribe. \n",
